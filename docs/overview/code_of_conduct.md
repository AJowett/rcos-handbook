# RCOS Community Code of Conduct

Our **Community Code of Conduct** outlines some common ground rules all RCOS members are expected to abide by in order to make RCOS an inclusive experience for everyone. You can find the RCOS Community Code of Conduct [here](https://github.com/rcos/intro/blob/master/docs/code_of_conduct.md).

In addition to following the Community Code of Conduct, we strongly suggest that your project's repository includes a Code of Conduct as well. You can find a Code of Conduct template for your project that includes an abbreviated version of our Code of Conduct as well as space for any project-specific ground rules [here](https://github.com/rcos/intro/blob/master/docs/project_coc_template.md). In addition, Github has instructions on including a Code of Conduct in your project [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/).
