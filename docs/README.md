# Welcome to RCOS

The [Rensselaer Center for Open Source](https://rcos.io) (RCOS for short) is a large community of open source developers who develop code to solve societal problems. The goal of RCOS is to provide a creative, intellectual and entrepreneurial outlet for students to use the latest open-source software platforms to develop applications that solve societal problems.

Internally, it is often fondly said that "RCOS is anarchy", as there are very few rules and projects are free to organize and contribute however they want.

# What does RCOS do for you?

RCOS offers a unique, open-ended learning experience. In RCOS, a student can contribute to existing open source efforts, learn a new technology, find a development team, and work on their "passion projects".

RCOS offers a huge community of open source developers skilled in nearly any platform, framework or language. Generally we communicate over [our slack](https://rcos.slack.com), where answers to questions and insightful discussions in a wide variety of topics can be explored.

RCOS is offered for credit at RPI and fulfills a 4000 level technical elective.

# How to join RCOS

If you're an RPI student, hop in on our first meeting of the semester or join [our slack](https://rcos.slack.com) and message a faculty coordinator (@mskmoorthy or @turnew2).

If you're looking to get involved with RCOS as a member outside of RPI, email a [coordinator](coordinators@rcos.io) to get setup on the [rcos slack](#slack). In the meantime, you can create an account and fill in your profile on [Observatory](#observatory).
