# Bylaws

Our Bylaws are an extension of our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The Bylaws apply to RCOS meetings at RPI, including large group and small group meetings as well as bonus sessions, casual coding sessions, and any project meetings unless otherwise noted.

## Attendance Codes
Attendance codes are given during all RCOS small group, large group, and bonus sessions. When the attendance code is delivered, go to http://rcos.io, click "Attend", and enter the attendance code so you can be marked as present for the current session.

As much as we value sharing and openness, we also value integrity. Thus, we ask that you do not distribute attendance codes to people who are not currently attending the session. If you are caught distributing attendance codes to people who are absent, **both your attendance code as well as the attendance code(s) you distributed to others will be nullified**.

If you know in advance you will not be able to make an RCOS meeting, or unforeseen circumstances arise that make you unable to attend, please review our [Excused Absence Policy](/grading/attendance?id=excused-absence-policy) instead of attempting to enter an attendance code.

## Noise
An important part of RCOS is being able to hear from both fellow RCOS members and guest speakers. We ask that you please refrain from talking or making excessive noise while a speaker is talking as it can be disruptive to the speaker and to your peers.

## During Large Group
During our large group sessions, we have the following policies.

### Presentations on Sensitive Topics

Please keep in mind that RCOS large group sessions are mandatory for all students currently in RCOS. Presentations containing detailed discussion of sensitive, upsetting, or controversial topics without warning can create an especially hostile environment when this attendance requirement is considered.

Presentations should not include any content that violates our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) or contains:
- Graphic violence or descriptions of violence
- Detailed and explicit discussions of potentially triggering topics (e.g. suicide, sexual assault, addiction, self-harm)
- Excessive profanity
- Nudity

If you're unsure about whether or not your talk conforms to the above guidelines, please reach out to a mentor or coordinator to discuss.

### Laptops/Mobile Devices
RCOS likes to maintain a culture of freedom. If you choose to use your laptop or mobile device during large group presentations, you may do so as long as you are mindful of the people around you. This includes:

* Muting all audio
* Not participating in audio or video calls
* Ensuring any material that may be visible on your screen is SFW (safe for work)
* Keeping mobile devices on "Silent" or "Vibrate"
* Using a quiet keyboard instead of a loud keyboard

In addition, some speakers may ask audience members to close all laptops and put away all mobile devices. If a speaker does so, please respect their request.

If you absolutely must take a phone call, you can exit the lecture hall to make/take a phone call. If you need to call emergency services for any reason, you may remain in the room while you make the call.

If you use assistive technology due to a documented disability or injury, or you use a medical device that may make noise or looks similar in appearance to a mobile phone or laptop, **please touch base with a faculty member ASAP**. This will remain confidential.

## Consequences of Code of Conduct Violations
If you violate the RCOS Community Code of Conduct or Bylaws, appropriate consequences will follow at the discretion of faculty. These may include:

* A verbal or Slack warning from a mentor or coordinator
* A written warning from a faculty advisor
* A request to edit or delete any project material that violates the Code of Conduct. Project material includes, but is not limited to, status updates, blog posts, code, comments, issues, pull requests, milestones, wiki pages, static websites, graphics, social media posts, etc. 
* If your large group talk or bonus session violates the Code of Conduct, your talk may be ended early and your slides will not be published to the #slides channel.
* If the violation occurred at an RCOS event or meeting, you may be removed from the event or meeting. This will be marked as an unexcused absence regardless of whether or not you already entered an attendance code, and you will not be able to make up this absence by attending a bonus session.
* In severe and repeated violations, you may be removed from RCOS entirely.
  * If you are taking RCOS for credit, you will receive a failing grade for the semester.
  * If you are currently a mentor, your mentorship position will be terminated immediately and you will be ineligible to mentor in future semesters. The same rule applies to coordinators.

Please note that the above list is not exhaustive and additional consequences may follow as appropriate.
