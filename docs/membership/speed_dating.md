Finding a team in RCOS isn't a requirement, but can often make RCOS easier for everyone. There are many ways to find a team but the easiest way is to look for teams during RCOS Pitch Days (the day when people say what projects they're going to be working on). If you're still looking for a team after pitch day, talk to your mentor or look for other groups in your small group.
