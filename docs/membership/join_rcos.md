# How to join RCOS

If you're an RPI student, hop in on our first meeting of the semester or join [our slack](https://rcos.slack.com) and message a faculty coordinator (@mskmoorthy or @turnew2).

If you're looking to get involved with RCOS as a member outside of RPI, email a [coordinator](coordinators@rcos.io) to get setup on the [rcos slack](#slack). In the meantime, you can create an account and fill in your profile on [Observatory](#observatory).

## Github

[Github](https://github.com/) is where most RCOS projects are stored and collaborated on within. You will need to create an account and eventually create or join a project.

## Observatory

[Observatory](https://rcos.io) is RCOS's open source project management platform. Every RCOS member is required to have an observatory account, it's through this platform that you can write blog posts, record your attendance and see other RCOS projects.

## Slack

[Slack](https://rcos.slack.com) is the primary communication platform for RCOS. Each team in RCOS has a Slack channel where they can coordinate meetings and manage the project.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control/collaboration system that is extremely popular among open source projects. To contribute in RCOS, you WILL need to learn to use git (it's not that bad). Try taking [github's git tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

## Finding an Open Source project to contribute to

[Github Explore](https://github.com/explore) allows you to explore Github and find awesome open source projects to contribute to. Spend a good amount of time finding a project that you like. Don't be intimidated! Many projects that seem very complicated are actively looking for new contributors and will give you "easy" issues to get started. You'll learn fast! Feel free to tackle issues as a team.
