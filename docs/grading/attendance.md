# Attendance

## Overview

Being part of the RCOS community means seeing what RCOS members are doing, giving feedback, and learning from tech talks and guest speakers. Attendence is required and is taken on Tuesdays and Fridays via Observatory.

Unexcused absences can be made up by attending bonus sessions. Generally bonus sessions are unique, long or workshop-style tech talks, an RCOS hackathon, or an optional RCOS session. Pay attention in the large group meeting to hear bonus sessions announced.

A student can have two unexcused absences before their grade is affected or make-ups are needed.

## Excused Absence Policy
Excused absences can be given for any of the following:
* Illnesses/injuries
* Family emergencies
* Job interviews
* Graduate school visits
* Religious holidays
* Conferences
* External hackathons
* Schedule conflicts with courses, exams, or extracurriculars

The above list is not exhaustive. If you are unsure about what constitutes an excused absence, please reach out to a coordinator or faculty member. However, excused absences will **not** be given if you are removed from a meeting for violating our [Code of Conduct](resources/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) or our [Bylaws](resources/bylaws.md).

Excused absences do **not** need to be made up with a bonus session (but you are encouraged to come to bonus sessions regardless!).
