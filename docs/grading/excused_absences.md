# Excused Absences

## Excused Absence Policy
Excused absences can be given for any of the following:
* Illnesses/injuries
* Family emergencies
* Job interviews
* Graduate school visits
* Religious holidays
* Conferences
* External hackathons
* Schedule conflicts with courses, exams, or extracurriculars

The above list is not exhaustive. If you are unsure about what constitutes an excused absence, please reach out to a coordinator or faculty member. However, excused absences will **not** be given if you are removed from a meeting for violating our [Code of Conduct](resources/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) or our [Bylaws](resources/bylaws.md).

Excused absences do **not** need to be made up with a bonus session (but you are encouraged to come to bonus sessions regardless!).
