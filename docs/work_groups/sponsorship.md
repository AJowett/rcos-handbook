# Sponsorship Team Responsibilities
- find new RCOS sponsors
- maintain relations with existing sponsors
- document the process  
- students interface with interesting companies to explore more sponsorship opportunities with RCOS
- leverage the fact that we have a massive open source community to lure interesting sponsors

Due to the monetary nature of sponsorship, the efforts of this work group will be managed with additional faculty oversight.

Interfaces with companies and organizations that may be interested in sponsoring RCOS with funds, cloud services, equipment, products, or swag. Cultivate relationships with new sponsors and maintain relationships with existing ones

For fungible assets there needs to be faculty - for first semester this would not be needed
