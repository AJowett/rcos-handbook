# Outreach Work Group

## Overview
The goals of the Outreach Work Group are to coordinate volunteer efforts and cultivate on-going relationships with the outside organizations these efforts benefit. While RCOS volunteer efforts may often be technical in nature, non-technical charitable work is also encouraged.

## Responsibilities
- Coordinate outside volunteer efforts
- Milena, Grace did a lot of volunteering events
- More opportunities for this type of outreach
- Doing this in a more official capacity would be superb

## Notes
- Any volunteer events can be counted as a bonus session with approval of a coordinator or faculty advisor.
