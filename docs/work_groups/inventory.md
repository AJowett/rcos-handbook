# Inventory Work Group
The goals of the Inventory Work Group are to maintain an up-to-date manifest of all RCOS-owned equipment and resources made available to student projects. Members of the Inventory Work Group will be tasked with collecting and validating resource acquisition requests, tracking which projects are actively using resources, and sometimes managing the re-acquisition of resources at the conclusion of the semester.

### Responsibilities
- Promoting campus resources that empower student makers (Forge Makerspace, Sage Prototyping Lab)
- Tracking what hardware and cloud resources are available to student projects
- Tracking which projects are actively using resources
- Assisting in the re-acquisition and cataloging of resources at the end of the semester
- Validating resource acquisition requests
