# Work Groups

Work Groups provide students flexible opportunities to develop their leadership skills and support RCOS as an organization.

Notes
- Teams are open to RCOS students, faculty, and alumni.
- Each team should have at least one mentor to manage on-going work
- TODO - describe the purpose of RCOS Teams
- TODO - document the process of joining a team (sign up forms, no elections!)

Other Potential Teams:
- Education
  - curates materials for self-education in RCOS

- Funds & Equipment
  - tracks and manages RCOS funds (treasurer, essentially)
  - tracks and manages RCOS equipment

## RCOS Teams
- If you work on a team you are essentially working on things that are important to running RCOS
- Each team should have one mentor to
- Document how to go into a team
- Sponsorship, outreach, managing funds would be some of the responsibilities of a RCOS team
- For fungible assets there needs to be faculty - for first semester this would not be needed

#### Outreach
- Management of tech speakers making sure we have a wide range of guest speakers
- Outreach -> find interesting speakers
- Maintain a list of past speakers
- Need to have more diverse speakers!
- students interface with interesting companies to explore more sponsorship opportunities with RCOS
- leverage the fact that we have a massive open source community to lure interesting sponsors

#### Volunteering  (from RCOS to outside of RPI)
- Milena, Grace did a lot of volunteering events
- More opportunities for this type of outreach
- Doing this in a more official capacity would be superb
