# Work Groups

Work Groups provide students flexible opportunities to develop their leadership skills and support RCOS as an organization.

- If you work on a team you are essentially working on things that are important to running RCOS

- All positions are volunteer based - no elections, not ever. Why no elections? We have chosen not to have elections as they often create more problems than they solve.

- Some of these responsibilities mirror those of a campus club.

- If you think there should be another work group, please [open an issue]().

- NOTE - work groups and not set in stone. Some groups may be combined or split up as their respective responsibilities evolve.

- Teams are open to RCOS students, faculty, and alumni.

The goals of RCOS Work Groups are:
- Provide opportunities for the broader RCOS community to have a role in running the organization
- Expand the reach of the organization and its ideals both inside and outside of RPI
- TODO - describe the purpose of RCOS Work Groups

### Requirements
- Consist of at least one mentor (student or alumni) and one non-mentor
- Each work group should have at least one mentor to manage on-going work
- Each team should have one mentor as a leader
- Each work group should have their own slack channel
- Each work group should produce documentation and/or blog posts detailing their efforts
- Each work group must schedule time to meet outside of RCOS to coordinate efforts. Meetings may be held in-person or remotely.

### Joining a Work Group
- TODO - document the process of joining a team (sign up forms, no elections!)
- Document how to go into a team:
  - fill out the form
  - join the slack channel

### Leading a Work Group
- TODO - document the process of leading a work group
- Responsible for organizing bi-monthly meetings / calls
- Responsible for writing and publishing minutes from said meetings
- Evaluate the on-going efforts of work group membership
- Concept and document the granular tasks the group will undertake during the semester
- TODO - where should minutes be placed?

### Defunct Work Groups
If there are no students or alumni available or willing to manage a Work Group, it should designated as _defunct_. Should a Work Group become defunct, the link to its documentation should be removed from the RCOS handbook's sidebar and moved into this section. This method enables future members find defunct groups and resurrect them if they desire.
